This project leverages a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast stock prices using historical data such as closing prices retrieved via the yfinance API. Designed to handle the sequential and non-linear nature of financial time series, the model processes normalized data through a stack of LSTM, Dense, and Dropout layers to predict future stock movements. It uses MinMaxScaler for preprocessing, a 60-day time window for input sequences, and is trained on 80% of the data with evaluation via Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The project aims to enhance forecasting accuracy, supporting traders, investors, analysts, and FinTech applications with reliable insights and visualizations using tools like TensorFlow and Matplotlib.
